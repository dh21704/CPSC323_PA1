# Lexer Project

## What Does This Project Do?
This program reads a source file, identifies tokens and lexemes, separates them, and creates an output file that lists each token alongside its corresponding lexeme.

## Overview
The program takes an input file containing simple C++ source code and outputs a list of recognized tokens, such as identifiers, integers, and punctuation marks.

## How to Run
1. Save your code as **lexer.py**
2. Ensure your input file is named **input_sourcecode.txt**
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python lexer.py
